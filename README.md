## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages:

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Go to your repository settings
3. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
5. Push any changes to the `main` branch - the site will automatically build and deploy

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project
4. The built files will be in the `docs` folder
5. Push the `docs` folder to your repository
6. In GitHub repository settings > Pages, set source to "Deploy from a branch" and select `main` branch with `/docs` folder

### Important: Preserve the `.nojekyll` File

**⚠️ DO NOT DELETE the `.nojekyll` file!** 

The `.nojekyll` file in the `docs` folder is essential for GitHub Pages to work correctly with this React SPA setup. This file tells GitHub Pages:

- **Not to process the site with Jekyll** (GitHub's default static site generator)
- **To serve files with underscores** (like `_next`, `_app`, etc.)
- **To handle client-side routing properly** with the 404.html redirect

If you delete this file, you may experience:
- 404 errors on direct URL access
- Broken asset loading
- Routing issues with React Router

The `.nojekyll` file is automatically created during the build process and should be preserved in your repository.
